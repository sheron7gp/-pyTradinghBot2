#Here is the continuation of the previous example, showing how you might use the CCXT
#library and the MACD indicator to build a trading bot in Python that includes take profit
#and stop-loss orders:

import ccxt

# create an instance of the Binance exchange
binance = ccxt.binance()
# authenticate with Binance using your API key and secret
binance.apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# define the target profit and maximum loss levels for take profit and
stop-loss orders
target_profit = 0.05
max_loss = 0.01
# fetch the latest price data for the BTC/USDT trading pair
data = binance.fetch_ticker('BTC/USDT")
# calculate the MACD indicator using the price data
macd, signal, histogram = MACD(np.array(data['close']), fastperiod=12,
                               slowperiod=26, signalperiod=3)
# use the MACD signals to make trading decisions
if macd[-1] > signal[-1] and histogram[-1] > 0:
    # MACD indicates an uptrend, so buy BTC
order = binance.create_order('BTC/USDT', 'futures', 'buy', 1, 18_000)
# set a take profit order to sell BTC when it reaches the target
profit level
binance. create_order('8TC/USDT', 'futures', 'sell', 1, 10_000 * (1 +
                                                                  target_profit), {'orderType': 'TAKE_PROFIT'})
# set a stop-loss order to sell BTC when it reaches the maximum loss
level
binance.create_order('BTC/USDT', 'futures', 'sell', 1, 10_808 * (1 -
                                                                 max_loss), {'orderType': 'STOP_LOSS'})
elif macd[-1] < signal[-1] and histogram[-1] < 8:
    # MACD indicates a downtrend, so sell BTC

                             10_000

                             binance.create_order("BTC/USDT", "futures", 'buy", 1, 10_000 * (1 -
                                                                                             target_profit), {'orderType': 'TAKE_PROFIT'})
                             # set a stop-loss order to buy BTC when it reaches the maximum loss
                             level
                             binance.create_order("BTC/USDT", "futures', 'buy", 1, 10_000 * (1 +
                                                                                             max_loss), {'orderType': 'STOP_LOSS'})


#This is just a very simple example to illustrate the basics of using the CCXT library and the
#MACD indicator to build a trading bot in Python that includes take profit and stop-loss
#orders. In practice, you would need to write more sophisticated code to manage your
#trading strategy and account. For example, you might want to use additional indicators to
#confirm your signals, or implement risk management techniques to protect your account
#from losses.
