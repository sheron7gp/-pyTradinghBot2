#write me a delta neutral market making bot in python using ccxt for gate exchange Here is an example of a delta neutral market making bot in Python using the 'ccxt library:
#Copy code
# Define the exchange and market to trade on
gate = ccxt.gate({
    'enableRateLimit': True,
    'apiKey': config.GATE_API_KEY,
    'secret': config.GATE_SECRET_KEY
})

balance = gate.fetch_balance()
exchange = gate.fetch_ticker()
market = 'RIN/USDT'
# Define the initial delta
delta = 0.0
# Define the spread and size for the orders
spread = 0.001
size = 0.1
# Define the amount to adjust the orders by
adjustment = 0.001
# Place the initial orders
order1 =exchange.create_limit_buy_order(market, size, delta - spread/2)
order2 = exchange.create_limit_sell_order(market, size, delta + spread/2)
while True:
    # Get the latest order book for the market
order_book = exchange.fetch_order_book(market)
# Calculate the mid-price and the new delta
mid_price = (order_book['bids'][0][@] + order_book['asks'][0][0]) / 2
new_delta = mid_price - delta
# Check if the delta has changed significantly
if abs(new_delta) > adjustment:
    # Cancel the existing orders
exchange.cancel_order(order1['id'])
exchange.cancel_order(order2['id'])
# Update the delta
delta = mid_price
# Place new orders at the updated delta
order1 = exchange.create_limit_buy_order(market, size, delta - spread/2)
order2 = exchange.create_limit_sell_order(market, size, delta + spread/2)


#This bot uses the 'ccxt' library to connect to the 'gate' exchange and trade on the
#BTC/USDT * market. It starts by placing two limit orders at a certain spread around the
#initial delta. The bot then continuously checks the latest order book for the market,
#calculates the mid-price, and updates the delta. If the delta has changed significantly, the
#bot cancels the existing orders and places new orders at the updated delta. This allows
#the bot to maintain a delta neutral position, and it can help to provide liquidity and earn
#the spread on the market.
